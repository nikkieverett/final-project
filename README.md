# final-project
Recipe Storage Database

This was my final project for The Iron Yard Front End Fundamentals Spring 2017 cohort.

This app was designed and built by me using:
FRONT END TECHNOLOGIES-
React JS w/ (create-react-app, react-router, redux)
jQuery AJAX
SASS

BACK END TECHNOLOGIES-
MongoDB (mongoose)
Express
Node.js

and is deployed using HEROKU.

To start scripts:
-From client folder run npm start to launch app in browser, and "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive" to launch sass watch.
-From server folder run server.js to start servers.
