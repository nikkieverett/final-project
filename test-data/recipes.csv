Drain the pasta well; reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water to use in the sauce if you wish.Meanwhile; heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium flame.

Toss the garlic into the fat and saute for less than 1 minute to soften.Add the hot; drained spaghetti to the pan and toss for 2 minutes to coat the strands in the bacon fat. Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in a mixing bowl; stirring well to prevent lumps. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta; whisking quickly until the eggs thicken; but do not scramble (this is done off the heat to ensure this does not happen.) Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water; until it reaches desired consistency. Season the carbonara with several turns of freshly ground black pepper and taste for salt.

Chicken is good too.The only prep work is to brown your sausage; whichever kind you choose.This kind of chicken sausage; although fully cooked; just needs to be browned for extra flavor.Ingredients:1 (19oz) bag of frozen cheese tortellini 1 small bag of fresh spinach (I used about half of a 5 oz package; but more is better!)2 (14.5 oz) cans of Italian style diced tomatoes; drained1 block (8 oz) of cream cheese** (softened in microwave)1 lb. of ground sausage or chicken/turkey sausage3-4 cups of chicken broth (start with 3; add 1 more if it looks like it needs it)Brown the sausage and put all ingredients in crockpot;chunking up the cream cheese.Cook on low for 4-6 hrs.Serves 4-6 *Keep an eye on your tortellini; it may be done sooner.*If still soupy; leave lid off for the last half hour or so of cooking.,4Supper on a Bread Slice,,main course,Intermediate,4,I used cheddar instead of velveeta.

Put the widest bit of the dough in the bottom. You may have to do this in two batches if you only have the one muffin tin.Scoop pie filling into each crescent roll dough piece. Be generous with the pie filling.It's okay if a little seeps out during baking. I actually like when you can see the bit of pie filling bubbling out while baking. It also lets folks see what they are gonna be eating before then even bite into it. You want to bite into these and get a nice taste of the cherry filling. Because remember; the dough is really gonna puff uparound these. A good 3 to 4 heaping tablespoons should work. I'm guessing about 6 or so cherries in each one.Start folding the dough around the filling as best you can. You should have three corners to pull in. Again; leaving small open gaps are totally okay here. The filling doesn't have to be totally covered.Bake for about 13­14 minutes.Note: Make sure the rolls are cooked all the way. You don't want to bite into these and still have some of the crescent roll be doughy and not totally baked. They should be fairly firm to the touch and have nice; tan­brown tops. 14 Minutes was just about right in my oven. They appeared done at the 12 minute mark but I let them gojust a bit longer to make sure they were totally done.Now for the glaze. In a bowl; whisk together powdered sugar and milk until it is smooth reaches a desired consistency. With a spoon; drizzle glaze over the warm bites.,cheddar risotto cakes,http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fontina-risotto-cakes-with-fresh-chives-231263,side dish,Time Consuming,4,would be great with marinara,10Noodle Soup with Meatballs,http://corazoncontentoconley.com/recetas/caldo-albondigas-fideos/,main course,Intermediate,3,,Pulled Chicken Tacos,http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241534/slow-cooker-pulled-chicken-tacos/,main course,,,1 1/2 pounds boneless; skinless chicken thighs (or mix of thighs and breasts)Great Value: Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts; 48 oz In Stores Only See Everyday Low Price ADVERTISEMENT 1 teaspoon salt; divided 1/2 teaspoon crushed black pepper; divided 1 small onion; diced 4 cloves garlic; crushed 1 jalapeno; halved* 3/4 cup orange juice 2 limes; juiced 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 small bunch cilantro; stems cut off and leaves coarsely chopped 12 corn tortillas Serving suggestions: diced red onion; chopped cilantro leaves; fresh lime juice Add all ingredients to listDirectionsPrint Prep10 mCook4 hReady In4 h 10 mLine a 4-6 quart slow cooker with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner.Trim any large pieces of fat from chicken thighs.
